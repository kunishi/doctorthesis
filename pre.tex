\section{Workflow Management Systems}
\label{sec:pre:wfms}

\subsection{Basic Concepts}

\emph{Workflow} is a concept for automating or reengineering business
processes in an organization \cite{abbott:cscw94, georgakopoulos:jdps95,%
schal:book96}.  However, there is little agreement for the features a
workflow management system must provide.  This is because the term
``workflow'' uses in various situations: business process specification,
business process automation, business process reengineering, etc.
Moreover, in the domain of workflow management, products are developed
earlier than researches with strict definitions or theorems.  Here are a
few examples of workflow products \cite{georgakopoulos:jdps95}: Lotus
Notes from Lotus Development Corp., FloWare from Recognition
International, Staffware from Staffware Corp., DocuFLOW from Inventor
Inc., WorkMAN from Reach Software Corp., ActionWorkflow from Action
Technologies, TeamLinks for Pathworks from Digital Equipment Corp., etc.

In 1996, Workflow Management Coalition \cite{wfCoalition}, international
organization for standardization of workflow software technology,
published a document about workflow software terminology
\cite{96:wfCoalitionTC1011}.  This document explains almost all
important concepts of workflow model.

A workflow defines a collection of \emph{process instances} organized to
accomplish some business processes, the order of process instances to be
invoked, and several conditions under process instances invocations.
In \cite{96:wfCoalitionTC1011} there are five kinds of the invocation
order:
\begin{itemize}
 \setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
 \setlength{\parskip}{0mm}
 \item AND-Split.  A single thread of control splits into two or more
       parallel processes.
 \item AND-Join.  Two or more parallel executing processes converge into
       a single common thread of control.
 \item OR-Split.  A single thread of control makes a decision upon which
       branch to take when encountered with multiple alternative
       workflow branches.
 \item OR-Join.  Two or more alternative processes workflow branches
       re-converge to a single common process as the next step
       within the workflow.
 \item Iteration.  The repetitive execution of one or more workflow
       processes until a condition is met.
\end{itemize}

Each process instance is performed by human, by a team of humans, or by
softwares.  Moreover, each process instance may have subprocess
instances.  Therefore workflows can be constructed hierarchically.

A workflow is often described as a directed graph whose nodes and arcs
represent business tasks and their invocation order respectively.  Note
that the graph may have cycles because business tasks sometimes repeats
until their aims are attained.  Figure \ref{fig:wfexample} shows an
example of workflow.  In this workflow, the processes ``Review 1'',
``Review 2'', and ``Review 3'' are executed concurrently.  Hence, the
invocation order from ``Distribute Papers'' to ``Review 1'', ``Review
2'', and ``Review3'' should be ``AND-Split''; the order from ``Review
1'', ``Review 2'', ``Review 3'' to ``Combine Reviews'' should be
``AND-Join''.

\emph{Workflow management} is a technology to support automation or
reengineering using workflows.  It mainly organized from these four
procedures:
\begin{enumerate}
 \setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
 \setlength{\parskip}{0mm}
 \item defining workflows by analyzing the business processes to be
       managed.
 \item instantiating workflows by assigning several variables with real
       instances --- for example, organization role name with human name.
 \item executing instantiated workflows.  It is similar with the
       execution of finite automaton.  First an initial task (state) is
       set, and when receiving transition events, tate transitions are
       invoked with some actions such as sending E-mail for
       notifications.
 \item restructuring workflows for optimization of business processes.
\end{enumerate}
These procedures are invoked at the endless order; that is,
restructuring workflows results into defining new workflows, and
starting a new procedure sequence.

A workflow management system consists of software components to store
and interpret process definitions, to create and manage workflow instances
to execute them, and to control the interactions with users.  In order to
store process definitions and to manage execution status of workflows,
databases are indispensable component of workflow management systems.

\subsection{Previous Researches}

\begin{sloppypar}
 Workflow management systems provide methodologies to support
 \cite{georgakopoulos:jdps95}:
\end{sloppypar}
\begin{enumerate}
 \setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
 \setlength{\parskip}{0mm}
 \item business process modeling to capture business processes as
       workflow specifications.
 \item business process reengineering to optimize specified processes.
 \item workflow automation to generate workflow implementations from
       workflow specifications.
\end{enumerate}
In addition, workflow management systems support asynchronous
distributed cooperative work whose structure is well-defined in most
cases.

Another methodology of workflow management systems is transaction
management.  That is, cooperative work supported by workflow management
systems is routine work, and many numbers of transactions, some of these 
sharing office resources, run concurrently during workflow management.

Hence, in the workflow area, researches and developments had been
advanced from these three directions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \begin{sloppypar}
	\emph{Process modeling approach}.  This approach mainly focuses on
       	business process modeling, business process automation, business
       	process reengineering including dynamic change mechanism, etc.
       	Many formal models of business process have been proposed based
       	on this approach: Petri-net based \cite{ishii:tripsj86,%
       	ishii:jip91, blumenthal:coocs95, ellis:coocs95}, state transition
       	diagram based \cite{humphrey:icse89, harel:ieeese90,%
       	sarin:cocs91, jarke:ijicis92, swenson:coocs93, isaka:tripsjgw96},
       	distributed knowledge-base based \cite{tueni:studiescscw91,%
       	jarke:ijicis92, plexousakis:coocs95, mahling:ieeeexpert95,
	robinson:nsf96}, etc.
       \end{sloppypar}
 \item \begin{sloppypar}
	\emph{Groupware approach}, \cite{shepherd:cscw90, kaplan:cocs91,%
       	medina-mora:cscw92, mahling:coocs93, tarumi:tipsj95} for example.
       	This approach views workflow management system as a kind of
       	groupware supporting cooperative activities of human beings in a
       	distributed environment.  It mainly focuses on communication
       	theory \cite{winograd:book86, mahling:coocs93}, flexible support
       	for human communications \cite{mazer:toois84, bogia:coocs93,%
       	blumenthal:coocs95, iiduka:tripsj96}, system architecture
       	including GUI \cite{kaplan:cocs91}, toolkits for implementing
	WFMSs \cite{forst:jdps95}, etc.
       \end{sloppypar}
 \item \emph{Database approach},  \cite{georgakopoulos:ijicis94,
       rusinkiewicz:adbis94, krishnakumar:jdps95, alonso:icde96} for
       example.  This approach mainly views from transaction management
       from database point of view, such as transaction model supporting 
       transaction hierarchies and concurrency control, 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benefits for Workflow Management by Using Database Technologies}

As described in the previous section, databases bring some benefits
into workflow management systems, especially in transaction management
area.  Transaction management in databases are useful when workflow
management systems become very large, for example involving thousand of
users in wide area networks.

However, as mentioned in \cite{alonso:nsf96}, applying database
technologies to workflow management bring several benefits other than
transaction management, such as interoperability among several workflow
management systems.
Interoperability is one of the very serious problems in workflow
management area, because workflow management technologies have been
leaded by commercial products, no interoperability in each other.

Database technologies will be helpful for resolving interoperability
problem in workflow management by providing general purpose workflow
manipulation languages, like SQL in data management.  Therefore database 
technologies can provide the infrastructure for managing workflows in
more general and flexible way than in conventional WFMSs technologies.
